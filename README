Pokebot
-------

Pokemon desmume bot. This is an autoit bot that attaches to desmume, detects game state, and sends input to control the game. Currently only grinding is supported.

It is recommended to leave the game on fast forward. The bot uses PixelSearch and should work for any resolution, but for performance it is suggested to keep it in 1x size.

The bot will continuously move left and right until entering an encounter. Upon detecting an encounter, fight will always be selected, and the first move selected ad infinitum.

Install
-------
Install AutoIT 3.x or above

Usage
-----
Ensure game is loaded and fast forward is set to max, 4x for maximum potential (press = a few times)

Execute pokebot.au3 with the appropriate architecture for your machine (if on 64 bit OS, "Run Script (x64)")

Pause on the keyboard with the "pause" key, and close via system tray when desired
